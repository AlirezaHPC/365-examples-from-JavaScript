//     Rate per cubic meter of water according to consumption rate such as consumption
// It is different at home, commercial or industrial. A program that measures the amount of water consumption per cubic meter and type
// Reads the consumption of a number of subscribers, calculates and prints their water bill. To calculate water consumption, 
// the following method is used:
// If the type of Egypt is the letter H or h (home Egypt), 500 for every 166 cubic meters of consumption
// Rials are received.
// If the type of consumption of the letter I or i is entered (industrial consumption up to four million cubic meters), for each
// 1000 cubic meters of water is 750 Rials and for each cubic meter more than that, 0.00025 is added to the bill amount.
// If the Egyptian type E or e is entered (commercial consumption), if Egypt water up to two million
// Cubic meters, for every 1500 cubic meters of Egypt 600 Rials and for every cubic meter more than 0.00004 will be added to the bill.
