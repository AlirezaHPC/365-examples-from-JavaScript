// If you have three pieces of wood, you may be able to make a triangle with
//  them and you may not. For example, if the length of one of the three pieces
//   is 12 inches and each of the other two pieces is one inch, you certainly can
//    not glue the two ends of the one-inch pieces together so that after connecting 
//    to the 12-inch piece, the connection point They should be in the middle of it. 
//    There is a simple test that can be used to determine whether a triangle can be
//     created with three lines of different lengths.
// If the length of each of the three line segments is greater than the sum
//  of the lengths of the other two line segments, you cannot use them to
//   create a triangle. Otherwise you can use them to create a triangle.
// Write a function called is_triangle that takes three integers as 
// arguments and prints the "yes" or "no" messages, depending on how you can 
// print the triangle with the parameters.
// Write a function that takes the lengths of the sides from the user and
//  converts them to integers, and then uses the is_triangle function to test the 
//  possibility of constructing a triangle using them
